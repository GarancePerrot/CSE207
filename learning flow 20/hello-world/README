For all the programs, the header file contains the declaration of the functions (other than main which is not declared),
and the soucre file contains their implementation and the main function that is called automatically. 

The program hello-world prints the string "hello world" when it is run. 

The program international-hello-world prints the string "Bonjour le monde!" or its translation in English, 
Spanish, Chinese or Danish depending on the LANGUAGE variable that is defined at the top of the makefile. 

The program fancy-hello-world prints the string "Hello World, hello NAME" where NAME is a variable that the user 
has to type on the keyboard after calling the function. See copy of the code for more details.
