These programs allow to create a UDP connection between a client and a server. 

The client reads a string from the keyboard, sends it to the server. 
Same for the fancy client but then it reads the string from the server and prints it on the screen.
The server receives data from the client and sends back the exact same message.

I took inspiration from the following youtube videos:

"UDP client program" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tphRJEvKysM&t=301s
"UDP server program" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD0D0JmXVlg&t=266s
"The Most Simple UDP Client Server Program In C!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUyaV4haBUE

To test the code:
On two different terminals T1 and T2: (4455 is an example of port number)

T1: gcc server.c -o server
    ./server 4455

T2: gcc fancyclient.c -o fclient
    ./fclient "127.0.0.1" 4455
    Type a message and press enter

The message should be sent to the server, received by it, and sent back to the client and received by it.
